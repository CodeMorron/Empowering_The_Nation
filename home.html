          Empowering the Nation is a skills development initiative founded in
          2018 by Precious Radebe. We are dedicated to upskilling domestic
          workers and gardeners in Johannesburg through comprehensive training
          programs. Our courses, ranging from short six-week modules to
          six-month learnerships, empower individuals with marketable skills,
          making them more competitive in the job market. By investing in their
          future, we enable workers to enhance their employment opportunities,
          earn higher wages, and even start their own businesses. Join us in
          building a brighter future for our community!

          <p>
              Empowering the Nation has completely transformed the way I look at domestic work.
             After completing the six-week skills program, I now feel confident and capable of taking on more advanced tasks.
             The training is hands-on, practical, and the support is incredible.

         <p>
           As a gardener, I always wanted to improve my skills but didn't know where to start. 
           Thanks to Empowering the Nation, I now have advanced landscaping skills, and my services are in high demand. 
           I even started my own small gardening business!

          "I enrolled my domestic worker in the Learnership program, and the results have been amazing. 
          She's now trained in household management and childcare, and it's been such a positive experience for our family. 
          I highly recommend this training school!"
